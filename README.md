**From basics of networks (graphs) to modelling dynamics on and of network.**

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of Network Science, guiding you from the foundational aspects of networks (or graphs) through to the modelling of dynamic phenomena occurring on and within these networks.

## Purpose
I embarked on a self-guided journey through the fascinating world of Network Science. Recognizing the value and insights I gained, I decided to compile this repository, sharing my journey to help others traverse the learning curve with more ease and clarity.

## Repository Contents
**Fundamentals of Networks:** Located in the "Basics on Network" folder, this section introduces key network terminologies like adjacency matrix and degree, and provides insights into topological properties. You'll find demonstrations of graph construction and visualization, as well as the generation of random graphs.

**Dynamics on Networks:** This section delves deeper into the exploration of the behavior of random walkers on various networks. By implementing a custom-built random walker function, we examine various facets of a graph, particularly focusing on the identification of subgroups. This section also studies the dynamics of node statuses, such as rumors, and showcases the influence of network topology on rumor propagation.

**Dynamics of Networks:** Network dynamics models capture network changes over time, such as the addition and removal of nodes and edges. This section has three parts dealing with the dynamics like small world network and preferential attachment network.


By systematically exploring the above aspects, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Network Science and its practical applications.
