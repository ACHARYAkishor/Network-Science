# Network-Science
**From basics of networks (graphs) to modelling dynamics on and of network.**

I learned network science on my own and I would like to share my learning curve to others in this repository. 

Note: An interactive, dynamic simulation model in Python will be made by using PyCX’s “pycxsimulator.py” file, which is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pycx/files/
